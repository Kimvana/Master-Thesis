# Master-Thesis

This page contains all supporting files for my master thesis. 

The script generallayer.py generates input files of perovskite crystals for the MD program GROMACS. Using GROMACS, a trajectory can be calculated, as well as the dipole moment of the system through time.
The script 'ACF calculator.py' calculates the autocorrelation function from GROMACS dipole moment data.
The script farIR.py calculates the far-IR spectrum of the ACFs generated using GROMACS or 'ACF calculator.py'.

The different .itp files are ready for use in GROMACS trajectory calculations.
